# OpenInputOSD
OpenInputOSD is small OSD (on-screen display) showing which inputs (keyboard keys, mouse buttons) are being held.

### TODO
- Dynamic input recognition mode
- Mouse input tracking
- Gamepad input tracking
- Option to add a different display name to a tracked key/button/axis/etc.
- Option to do logical operations on tracked inputs???
- Saving settings
